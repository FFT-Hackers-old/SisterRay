# SisterRay
Sister Ray is a modularized engine re-implementation for FFVII. It is a rewrite of large sections of the engine designed to make source-code modding of the original game feasible and allow much more in-depth mods than have been possible in the past.

Key Features: 
A central event system, to which mods will be able to register callbacks using the sister-ray API
A widget system to facilitate the create and manipulate of GUI elements and menus
Modularization of much of the games battle engine to facilitate adding new commands, mechanics, damage formulas, etc

Further down the road:
A public API against which cod mods can be written and loaded. Data driven approaches to most game resources.

Launch Mods:
Sister-Ray includes default modifications to the game using the re-implemented engine. These include:
In Battle PHS (Swapping characters a la FFX)
Limit Break rework (Limit no longer replaces the attack command, and all known limits are usable instead of just the "current" level)
Stagger Mechanics/Cast Times.
Elemental and Status Resistances/Affinites for greater stat depth

These mods will be selectable/configurable in the eventual release

SisterRay is powered by Cid and Mog
